#Develop a NotificationManager module for the Jarvis Crypto Bot (JCB) that manages sending notifications and alerts based on predefined conditions, such as significant price movements, trade executions, or strategy performance metrics. The module should support multiple notification channels, such as email, SMS, and push notifications. Please suggest any additional features, functionality, or performance capabilities that can improve the NotificationManager module based on the intended success of the JCB.
